                <div id="textField" style="display: none;">
                   <p>  Vilma is a young and ambitious woman in her 20s who lives in the heart of
                     Soho, New York City. Her fast-paced career as an investment banker demands her full 
                     attention and often keeps her immersed in the bustling world of finance. 
                     To counterbalance the demands of her hectic lifestyle, Vilma has found solace 
                     and respite in the tranquil and enchanting Elizabeth Street Garden.</p>

                  <p>  When she's not crunching numbers or attending high-stakes meetings, 
                    Vilma eagerly seizes any opportunity to escape to the garden, which is just a 
                    stone's throw away from her apartment. The garden serves as her personal sanctuary,
                     where she can disconnect from the city's hustle and unwind in a peaceful oasis. 
                     Surrounded by lush greenery and vibrant blooms, she finds a sense of serenity that
                      helps her rejuvenate both physically and mentally.  
                    </p>
                    
                   <p>  Vilma's attire in the park reflects her love for simplicity and comfort.
                    She often dons casual yet stylish attire, opting for soft, flowing fabrics
                     and comfortable sneakers to allow her to fully immerse herself in the calming 
                     environment of the garden.
                    </p>
                    
                  <p> With a heart full of wanderlust, Vilma enjoys wandering through the garden, 
                    taking in the delicate fragrances of flowers, listening to the gentle chirping
                     of birds, and soaking up the warm sunshine. She's a true nature enthusiast and 
                     relishes the opportunity to escape the city's skyscrapers, if only for a brief moment.
                    </p> 
    
                  
                  <p> Vilma's visits to the Elizabeth Street Garden not only provide her with the 
                    necessary respite but also inspire her to cherish the beauty of simplicity amidst
                     the chaos of her demanding career. Her appreciation for the little things in life 
                     makes her a well-rounded individual who is capable of finding balance in her busy world.
